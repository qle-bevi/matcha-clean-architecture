Matcha is a project of school 42.

It's a dating site.

I wanted to make me familiar with [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) by redoing this project.


## Installation

Use the package manager composer to install matcha.

```bash
composer install
```

## Run tests

```bash
composer tests
```

## Check code quality

```bash
composer sniff
```
